## Description:
**Title**: Analysis of Marketing Campaigns for VPN Sponsorships via Just Chatting Streams on StreamZone

Description: This university project involves the development of a database to analyze the performance of marketing campaigns associated with "Just Chatting" streams on StreamZone. SecureNet requested a technical analysis of VPN product sponsorships through this category. The "Just Chatting" category includes streams where creators interact with their audience, engaging in discussions on a variety of topics, such as news, current events, video games, TV shows, economy, movies, music, art, and more.

This project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of sponsorship strategies within this streaming category, focusing on audience engagement and campaign outcomes.
